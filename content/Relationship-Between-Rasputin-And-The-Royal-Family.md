### Introduction

The only son in the [Royal Family](Russian-1900s-Tsarist-Family), Alexis, inherited _hemophilia_ from her mother. This made him extremely ill. In search of treatment, [Rasputin](Gregory-Rasputin) was introduced to the [Tsarina](Tsarina-Alexandra) as an extremely healing man.

By 1900, Rasputin was already within the circle of the upper society in St. Petersburg, many of whom described him as a humorous peasant with a fascinating charisma. However, he never had the chance to work his way into royalty. In 1903, Rasputin was presented to the Montenegrin sisters, and he hoped to use them as his way into the royal family. However, he did not get his chance until 1905 when the French physician left.

They met, and several incidents later, whether true or not, convinced the Tsarina that Rasputin _was_ a holy man, and this brought them extremely close. It was told that the Tsarina had an affair with Rasputin, but there is not yet convincing proof.

### Healing Powers

It was not until mid-1907 when the man presented his healing abilities. Alexis had fallen and suffered from an internal bleeding. Alexandra sent for Rasputin, and the next day Alexis was well. The Tsarina claimed that Rasputin had came in the night and prayed for the Tsarevich. Since then he was proclaimed as an incredible healer, and hundreds came to him for his powers. More importantly, Alexandra became convinced that Rasputin was a helper, messenger, and a savior sent by God.

Rasputin lived the following decade with what was known as a “double life.” He presented his best to the royal family, frequently conducting acts of curing. Many historians suspected that Rasputin utilized a powerful hypnosis, while others hypothesized that he had some special medicine. Perhaps it was just some psychological auto-suggestion. On the other hand, he had a messy, sexual life, often caught drunk with ladies heading back to his home. This indeed became a point of criticism of opposition. Leaflets filled St. Petersburg, and even though the Tsar did try once to banish him, Alexandra brought him back and Nicholas II never bothered to try again. Notably, [Pyotr-Stolypin](Pyotr-Stolypin) also tried, but Rasputin hurried back immediately hurried back after Stolypin was murdered.

### War

After the [Tsar-Nicholas-II](Tsar-Nicholas-II) left for the front to command the [War](Russian-Participation-In-World-War-One), Rasputin used his influence to control Russia.

Many defeats in Germany in 1915 brought complaints towards the government. Suddenly, people noticed many officers and officials had German names. Rasputin was accused of working towards Russia’s defeat. As the Tsarina was from Hesse, the suspicion also flooded towards her.

This brought heavy criticism upon the royal family.
