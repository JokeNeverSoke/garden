As a general rule: do not use categories.

Most apps/websites/name anything provides two main ways of splitting items into groups: tags and categories. Both can be subdivided, but categories are mutually exclusive.

There is nothing wrong being mutually exclusive, but many times reality does not let us do so. Say, you may divide your diary entries into `School` and `Family`.  What if one day, somehow, your teacher visits you home? Or maybe your whole family went to the school Halloween event? Being mutually exclusive may be a big problem here.

Generally, if there is a need for mutual exclusivity, make a tag and put the categories as sub-tags within. Or, if you really need to, separate them into folders. Of course, for homework and projects at school there's nothing wrong putting them into folders.
