An Italian general called Tellini was appointed to supervise the border between Greece and Albania. On 27th of August, Tellini and his team was killed on the Greek side. On 31th of August, [Benito-Mussolini](Benito-Mussolini) bombarded and then occupied Corfu. 15 were killed.

The [League](League-Of-Nations) reacted by condemning Mussolini to retreat, asking Greece to pay compensations *if* Tellini's killers were to be found.

Mussolini refused. Britain wanted to refused, but the French backed the Italians as French forces were tied in the [Ruhr conflict](1923-Ruhr-Conflict).

Mussolini got his way, the Greeks were ordered to apologize and pay compensations.
