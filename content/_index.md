Welcome to my [garden ðŸŒ±](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history)!

I'm not quite sure how this is gonna work out, perhaps just something to toy with. Anyways, feel free to look around.

Some notes look weird because I either

- use them as a pipeline into [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/)
    - *generally speaking*, I don't do this unless I have to (cause stuff in your second brain don't need to be in your first brain)
- have not yet finished them yet (ever)
- me english bad

## Currently

Stuff I'm researching/studying/reviewing/purely thinking/etc. on currently.

- [AS Psychology](https://www.cambridgeinternational.org/programmes-and-qualifications/cambridge-international-as-and-a-level-psychology-9990/)
- Philosophy (as always)

## Backlog

There's plenty of stuff/thoughts/ideas that I wanted to evaluate and develop further ideas on. Wait on them, or message me in.

- How to eat elegantly (*grazioso*)
- Utility functions (usefulness/cost-benefit)

## Icebox

There are partial contents on [IGCSE History](History) and Economics, but I'm not finishing them.

There are also random notes from NLP/Neural Networks.
