Welcome to my [garden ðŸŒ±](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history)!

I'm not quite sure how this is gonna work out, perhaps just something to toy with. Anyways, feel free to look around.

Some notes look weird because I either

- use them as a pipeline into [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/)
    - *generally speaking*, I don't do this unless I have to (cause stuff in your second brain don't need to be in your first brain)
- have not yet finished them yet (ever)
- me english bad

## Currently

Stuff I'm researching/studying/reviewing/\* on currently.

- AS Psychology

## Icebox

There are partial contents on [IGCSE History](History) and Economics, but I'm not finishing them.

There are also random notes from NLP/Neural Networks.
