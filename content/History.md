# History

#tags, #meta, #history

Most of the notes here are from my [IGCSE History course](https://www.cambridgeinternational.org/programmes-and-qualifications/cambridge-igcse-history-0470/).

They include info from [Tsar Nicholas II](Tsar-Nicholas-II) all the way to [Hitler's foreign policies](Hitler-foreign-policy-aims.md). There is also a paper 4 in-depth study of Russia.
