Is there an ultimate motive that can explain all human thoughts & activities?

It should be measurable, and ideally different for each individual at different point of times.

However, this would require a difference be defined for a human being and a non-living object (e.g. rock). Otherwise the question of whether abiding the rules of natural science is decisive and motive-caused would arise. Due to this link, there could as well be a clearer definition of free-will and perhaps a proof of the existence of souls.
