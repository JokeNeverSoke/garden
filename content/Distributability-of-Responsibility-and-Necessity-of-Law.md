**Responsibility can be distributed**. For every single event, every single entity's existence and action that takes place before it takes credit. Of course, this sphere of effect expands reversely in time at the speed of light. One can affect events one light year away a year later, but not at the moment.

Therefore, it is impractical to determine the punishment of events based on responsibility. One might consider the possibility of an entity of preventing or modifying an event, weighing it with the possibility of other entities. However, this is also impractical due to the linearity of our current world. It also bases itself on the assumption of #free-will, which, is debatable.

Hence, a need of law arises. An ideal law should define the guidelines and expectations of living of every common citizen. Then, at the event of misfortune, relating citizens can be valued of their behavior in regards to this established law and receive equitable punishment.
