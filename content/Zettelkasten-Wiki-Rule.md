### TL;DR

Long term learning should be the \#1 focus for me (in many ways). Hence, this new vault's gonna be started (hope it can persist) by the #zettelkasten #note-taking method.

This [site](https://zettelkasten.de/) shows the fundamentals.

### Guidelines

- Generally, conform to the [official guidelines](https://zettelkasten.de/posts/overview/)
    - Notes should be formatted with scalability and atomicity in mind.
    - Don't use [categories but tags ](Organizing-Stuff-With-Tags-And-Categories) instead, more on that later
    - More wiki-links
- There should be no short-term emotion related diary-like entries. They do not contribute to long term learning. These should be recorded in #day-one, which is more helpful for self-reflection.
- **No** references to anything that...
    - isn't documented/noted, _or_
    - isn't linked to
    - rule of thumb: if a visitor that knows nothing about you finds some reference to something they don't know, either document it, link it, or trash it. Maybe years later the archive will become public. Who knows?
- Cite your external sources. Maybe use [zotero](https://zbib.org/)
- `Inbox` folder will be responsible for unorganized notes and notes that need to be reorganized
- `Archive`, as implied, for organized notes
- Tag long and short writing scripts with #writing
