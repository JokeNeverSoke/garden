The Rhineland was demilitarized according to [Treaty Of Versailles](Treaty-Of-Versailles), but Hitler wanted to re-militarize it in his [foreign policy](Hitler-foreign-policy-aims).

In March 1936, he moved his troops into the Rhineland. If the French response, he would be forced to retreat and become a huge humiliation for him. To his fortune, they did not.

The attention of the League was upon the [Abyssinian Crisis](Abyssinian-Crisis), British people felt sympathy, and the French were having an election and no one wanted to be blamed for an war, creating Hitler's success.
