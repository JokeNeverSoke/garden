## Content

Peasants that worked alone were joined in to large farms that provided common necessities.

### Productivity

Peasants worked in strip farms, which made modern machinery inefficient.
By introducing collectivization, productivity of agriculture would increase, as efficiency would increase, and collected farms would be able to afford these machinery

### Coordination

By introducing collectivization, grain collection of the government was made easier and more efficient.

It was also easier for government to inform peasants of what to produce.

### Opposition

Peasants that refused collectivization were labeled as _kulaks_.

- People opposed as it puts them under [government control](USSR-collectivization#Coordination)
- Kulaks did not wan't to share land/animal with weaker/poorer peasants
- People liked to work at own pace

### Consequences

Peasants ate all they can, as selling them would not earn money. Productivity rather decreased, as there was no profit motive, leading to greater famines.
