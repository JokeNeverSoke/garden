### Summary

Publicly known as a sex-maniac that has numerous relationships with prostitutes, noble ladies, and perhaps the [Tsarina](Tsarina-Alexandra) even.

### Early Life

Rasputin was born in a small village named Pokrovskoye where his ancestors settled sometime around mid-17th century. The family, as with other peasants living in Siberia, differed from the peasants working in Serfdom and, as noted, often abandoned their local officials during the night if they became too harsh. He never had education: no peasants were expected to have education when they were going to farm for their entire life.

A story told of an incident when he was twelve. He was sick in bed one night, and his father was investing a case of a stolen horse with some friends. Rasputin found his way to his father and pointed out to a man and accused him of the steal. Despite his father’s apology, few suspicious men still went to search the accused man’s house and, surprisingly, found the horse. The story was never proven, but it was believed and often told by Rasputin’s followers.

An incident turned his early life into a pilgrimage: he and his friends, ironically, was accused of another steal of two horses; his friends were found guilty, and he was to be banished. He suggested to go on a pilgrimage, and so he did, with destination as Greece. The long journey was certainly more burdening than a peasant’s everyday work. According to him, he walked 40-50 _versti_ (45-53 kilometres) on days without precipitation. Whatever the long pilgrimages brought him, he certainly was an uncommon man.
