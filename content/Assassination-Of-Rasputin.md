Prince Felix Yusupov did not have a good reason to murder [Rasputin was damaging the royal family's reputation](Gregory-Rasputin]]. He claimed it was for the good of Russia after fleeing from Russia. [[Relationship-Between-Rasputin-And-The-Royal-Family). Some historians suggested British involvement to prevent Russia from withdrawing from the war, but it was certainly not the British who committed the act.

The act was well plotted. He invited Rasputin to the Moika Palace for a party. The conspirators arrived at 11pm and faked a scene of a crazy party that has ended. Yusupov brought Rasputin down to the dining room, saying that his wife would join them once her guests left. He fed him cakes and wine, of which poisoned with cyanide powder. Rasputin chatted, his voice became low, and his throat seemed to be uncomfortable, but he was well. An hour passed, and Rasputin asked Yusupov to play the guitar for him.

Unable to wait, he left saying that he will go ask for his wife to accompany them, and went upstairs, telling the other conspirators of the failure. He went back down with a revolver and shot him. He then drove one of his friends impersonated as Rasputin back to the latter’s home, faking the return. They went back to the palace only to find Rasputin still alive. He jumped and ran, shouting the Prince’s name. One of the conspirators shot twice, missing, then a third shot that hit him in his back. A fourth short passed his forehead.

His body was not discovered until a few days later since the river was frozen. Autopsy did not find poison in his stomach nor water in his lungs: the gunshot was the fatal blow. He did not survive and struggle in the river. Perhaps the poison had worn out, or maybe did tests did not include a test for poison.
