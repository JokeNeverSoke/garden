There are many ways to structure a thought experiment where multiple consciousness gain access to time, where time is an abstract ability of knowledge and control over the linear dimension of time. For the sake of simplicity, let's assume that multiple observers have the access to overseeing the to-come future, including its full state. They could adhere to the actions they saw they did in the future, preserving it, or they could do something else, thereby modifying it.

Then, a paradox happens. Would _observer Alice_ foresee the future that are _before_ the modifications of _observer Bob_, or _after_ the modifications of _observer Bob_? This question, in many perspectives, is similar to the Consistency Availability problem. Hierarchy would not be a solution due to many reason. The future that _observer Bob_ modified might not be the future that _observer Alice_ saw. This, then, shows that Alice's power is not absolute, and could possibly be an impure function.

The solution would be simple. The observers with higher hierarchy would have to make their edits fulfill the observations of the lower observers (which is very demanding), _or_ limit observers into purely observing, and lacking the ability to modify, preventing interference. In the latter case, however, there would be no need in hierarchy anymore since there is only one possible future.

The former would also be not possible. Occam's razor suggests that over-complicated problems with simpler solutions should follow the simplest solution rather than complicated ones.

Another similar problem would be the ability to predict the future with relative accuracy. The prediction would be based on the current state of the world, and suggest a possible future. In fact, this is very similar to how humans think and predict. We take what we know, using our experiences, give a possible output. The accuracy of the prediction will be based on two factors: the amount of knowledge about the current state of the world/object of prediction, and the accuracy of the function used to take the state and transform it into a future state. If two observers were to predict on one same object, the observer with a better knowledge and better predicting functions would obtain the most accurate model. Interference would not interfere with the observation process since, observers could not obtain full knowledge of state, and, the state of other observers would be taken into account by observers with a better knowledge.

In this thought experiment, perfect prediction does not exist. There would be two main reasons why.

First of all, perfect knowledge is impossible. This is simple to understand.

The second reason is more interesting. There is no perfect function. As humans, we learn math not by understanding the concept $1+1=2$, but by observing patterns and gaining experience. Children quickly remember that $1+1=2$ when they put two bananas together, two iPhone together, and so on. Soon, they'll learn that $1+2=3$ because it is the same as $1+1+1$. The same goes for multiplication, and any other math concept. Functions build on top of each other. Without perfect knowledge, we also fail to gain access to perfect functions that can produce perfect output based on inputs. Our functions are only imitations of how nature _actually_ works, and they have their limitations.
