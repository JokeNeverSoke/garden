After the March Revolution, people began to oppose the war. In July, [Kerensy](Alexander-Kerensky) launched a major attack, which failed, sparking demonstrations, known as the **July Days**.

This improved the support of the [Bosheviks](Russian-Bolshevik-Party), but they were not ready to seize power.

Kerensky ordered troops to force the demonstrations down, and prosecuted Bolshevik leaders as the culprit behind the riot. [Lenin](Vladimir-Lenin) fled to Finland.
