First of all, us humans are undeniably social creatures. We cannot live without help from others, and to do so, helping others. A simple proof will be to count the hours of each person being alone, and the hours of him/her communicating with other humans. Despite the attempts of becoming alone, I find myself in a desperate need of relationships. You see, people often has this falsified image that introverts tend to have a higher productivity than extroverts. I cannot deny this on the bases of statistics, but more often the relationships that a person possess may worth way more than himself working alone.

You can find anyone in the world with an average of nine people in between. This is what the statistic experts on the internet say. With that speaking, you can see every extra person you know as an extra weapon, an extra backup. Relationships are resources, ones that you can trade in for more relationships. You'll make yourself attractive by choosing attractive friends, or more effectively, knowing more people. "Walking out of your comfort zone" was never some "sharing is caring" preschool song. It is you guidelines to being more productive, having more people backing you up, and finding help when you need it. Social media and emails are your weapons.

That being said, you should never treat people like they are tools. Talk more, think more. Of course, don't just talk into the void thinking the more words the better. Make them count.
