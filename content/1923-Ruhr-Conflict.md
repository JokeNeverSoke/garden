According to the [Treaty of Versailes](Treaty-Of-Versailles), Germany had to pay lots of reparations. They were paid in 1921, but not in 1922, which, in 1923, caused French and Belgium Soldiers to invade the Ruhr region to loot what was owed to them in the form of raw materials and goods.

Workers in the Ruhr were ordered by the German government to go on a strike. The French reacted by killing over 100 and expelling 100,000 from the region.

This then lead to hyperinflation.
