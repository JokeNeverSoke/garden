### Aim

- To investigate the level of obedience individuals would give to authority in context of resulting in physical harm to another person

### Background

After WWII, many Nazi war criminals defended in court that they were "just following orders." Some suggested that German citizens possessed defective personal traits, therefore **dispositional** arguments. Milgram, a Jewish, challenged this hypothesis and suggested a **situational** explanation where obedience to authority is greater than commonly known.

Before the study many of his students and colleagues did not believe that people, if any, would put the shocks to the maximum level given the procedures.

### Method

#### Design

- controlled observation/laboratory experiment later replicated

#### Sample

- 40 men between 20 and 50 years old
- volunteer sample
- unskilled workers, white collar workers, and professionals
- \$4.50 given for participation

#### Procedure

1. Arrived individually at the lab, a stooge was introduced as another participant. Drew pieces of paper from a hat to determine teacher/student, but the real participant was always the teacher
2. The stooge is strapped to a chair in front of the participant and beside the shock generator. The generator is labeled with voltages and words. The participant is then assured of the safety of the shocks, and given a demonstration shock.
3. They are then lead to a different room where they could not see the stooge, and told that they were connected by microphone. They then  were instructed to the task, where they read words and gave punishments as shocks to the stooge when given a wrong answer (they believed so).
4. During the task, the stooge gave wrong answers according to a pre-set plan (standardization). The stooge starts to protest at 300V and goes silent later. When the participant protests, the experimenter would give verbal orders to continue.
5. The task ends when the participant refuses to continue or 450V is reached. They are then debriefed and interviewed, reassured that the stooge was not harmed. A short question was given to estimate the pain of the 450V shock from 0 to 14.

### Results

| Voltage label           | Voltage Range (V) | #    |
| ----------------------- | ----------------- | ---- |
| Slight shock            | 15-60             | 0    |
| Moderate shock          | 75-120            | 0    |
| Strong shock            | 135-180           | 0    |
| Very strong shock       | 195-240           | 0    |
| Intense shock           | 255-300           | 5    |
| Extreme intensity shock | 315-360           | 8    |
| Danger: severe shock    | 375-420           | 1    |
| XXX                     | 435-450           | 26   |

- Most participants believed the situation
- The estimated mean of the final shock was 13.42/14
- Participants showed high levels of destructive obedience
- 65% gave the maximum shock, contrasting to the 3% estimated by Migram's students and colleagues.
- Signs of tension, nervousness, and stress were reported. Many sweated, shook, and groaned. 14/40 men had nervous laughter or smiles.
- One participant went into a violent seizure during the experiment and ended early.
- Comments commonly made:
  - "I don't think I can go on with this"
  - "I don't think this is very humane"
  - "I'm gonna chicken out"
  - "I can't do that to a man, I'll heart his heart"
- Participants showed signs of relief, wiped faces, sighed, and shook their heads after the task ended
- A small minority did not show stress and appeared calm during the procedure

### Conclusions

- Individuals are much more obedient to authority than we expect due to situational aspects
- Destructive obedience brings high levels of stress due to the conflict between obedience to authority and moral values of avoiding the harm of others

###  Strengths and weaknesses

#### Strengths

- controlled observation - controlled environmental variables
- procedure was standardized throughout - reliable
  - verbal commands
  - stooge reactions
- participants were convinced of the electric shock generator - validity
- sample selected carefully - wide range of occupations
- quantitative measure of obedience
- qualitative measures were used to capture behavior
- debriefed

#### Weaknesses

- sample small and biased for male and local area
  - low in generalizability
- no informed consent of punishment
- repeatedly deceived
  - chosen the role of teacher by chance
  - many felt like they had to continue to receive payments
- psychological harm was not prevented
- possible for long term disturbance
