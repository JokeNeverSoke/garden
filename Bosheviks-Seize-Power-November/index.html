The family, as with other peasants living in Siberia, differed from the peasants working in Serfdom and, as noted, often abandoned their local officials during the night if they became too harsh. He never had education: no peasants were expected to have education when they were going to farm for their entire life.\n\nA story told of an incident when he was twelve. He was sick in bed one night, and his father was investing a case of a stolen horse with some friends. Rasputin found his way to his father and pointed out to a man and accused him of the steal. Despite his father’s apology, few suspicious men still went to search the accused man’s house and, surprisingly, found the horse. The story was never proven, but it was believed and often told by Rasputin’s followers.\n\nAn incident turned his early life into a pilgrimage: he and his friends, ironically, was accused of another steal of two horses; his friends were found guilty, and he was to be banished. He suggested to go on a pilgrimage, and so he did, with destination as Greece. The long journey was certainly more burdening than a peasant’s everyday work. According to him, he walked 40-50 _versti_ (45-53 kilometres) on days without precipitation. Whatever the long pilgrimages brought him, he certainly was an uncommon man.\n\n## See Also\n\n- [Relationship-Between-Rasputin-And-The-Royal-Family](Relationship-Between-Rasputin-And-The-Royal-Family)\n- [Death of Rasputin](Assassination-Of-Rasputin)\n",title:"Untitled Page"},"/Hitler-foreign-policy-aims":{content:"---\n---\n\n## Tags\n\n#history\n\n## Content\n\nFour main aims\n\n### Lebensraum\n\nHe wanted to gain land from Eastern Europe.\n\n### Defeat Communism\n\nHitler wanted to carve an empire out of Russia's [Communism](Communism) by defeating it.\n\n### Abolish Treaty of Versailles\n\nHitler calls the government that signed the  [ToV](Treaty-Of-Versailles) the **november criminals**, utilizing [German hatred](German-Criticism-of-the-Treaty-Of-Versailles)\n\nHe also argues that people should have **self-determination**\n\n\n#### Anschluss with Austria\n\n[1938-Anschluss-with-Austria](1938-Anschluss-with-Austria)\n\n#### Sudetenland\n\n#### Saarland\n\nHitler feared that the plebiscite promised by the ToV might not go well, but his propaganda was a success\n\n#### Rhineland\n\n#### Rearmament\n\nHitler re-introduced conscription.

For the sake of simplicity, let's assume that multiple observers have the access to overseeing the to-come future, including its full state. They could adhere to the actions they saw they did in the future, preserving it, or they could do something else, thereby modifying it.\n\nThen, a paradox happens. Would _observer Alice_ foresee the future that are _before_ the modifications of _observer Bob_, or _after_ the modifications of _observer Bob_? This question, in many perspectives, is similar to the Consistency Availability problem. Hierarchy would not be a solution due to many reason. The future that _observer Bob_ modified might not be the future that _observer Alice_ saw. This, then, shows that Alice's power is not absolute, and could possibly be an impure function.\n\nThe solution would be simple. The observers with higher hierarchy would have to make their edits fulfill the observations of the lower observers (which is very demanding), _or_ limit observers into purely observing, and lacking the ability to modify, preventing interference. In the latter case, however, there would be no need in hierarchy anymore since there is only one possible future.\n\nThe former would also be not possible. Occam's razor suggests that over-complicated problems with simpler solutions should follow the simplest solution rather than complicated ones.\n\n~~Nolan, you're wrong!~~\n\n---\n\nAnother similar problem would be the ability to predict the future with relative accuracy. The prediction would be based on the current state of the world, and suggest a possible future. In fact, this is very similar to how humans think and predict. We take what we know, using our experiences, give a possible output. The accuracy of the prediction will be based on two factors: the amount of knowledge about the current state of the world/object of prediction, and the accuracy of the function used to take the state and transform it into a future state. If two observers were to predict on one same object, the observer with a better knowledge and better predicting functions would obtain the most accurate model. Interference would not interfere with the observation process since, observers could not obtain full knowledge of state, and, the state of other observers would be taken into account by observers with a better knowledge.\n\nIn this thought experiment, perfect prediction does not exist. There would be two main reasons why.\n\nFirst of all, perfect knowledge is impossible. This is simple to understand.\n\nThe second reason is more interesting. There is no perfect function. As humans, we learn math not by understanding the concept $1+1=2$, but by observing patterns and gaining experience. Children quickly remember that $1+1=2$ when they put two bananas together, two iPhone together, and so on. Soon, they'll learn that $1+2=3$ because it is the same as $1+1+1$. The same goes for multiplication, and any other math concept. Functions build on top of each other. Without perfect knowledge, we also fail to gain access to perfect functions that can produce perfect output based on inputs. Our functions are only imitations of how nature _actually_ works, and they have their limitations.\n",title:"Untitled Page"},"/Relationship-Between-Rasputin-And-The-Royal-Family":{content:"---\n---\n\n## Tags\n\n#history\n\n## Content\n\n### Introduction\n\nThe only son in the [Royal Family](Russian-1900s-Tsarist-Family), Alexis, inherited _hemophilia_ from her mother. This made him extremely ill. In search of treatment, [Rasputin](Gregory-Rasputin) was introduced to the [Tsarina](Tsarina-Alexandra) as an extremely healing man.\n\nBy 1900, Rasputin was already within the circle of the upper society in St. Petersburg, many of whom described him as a humorous peasant with a fascinating charisma. However, he never had the chance to work his way into royalty. In 1903, Rasputin was presented to the Montenegrin sisters, and he hoped to use them as his way into the royal family. However, he did not get his chance until 1905 when the French physician left.\n\nThey met, and several incidents later, whether true or not, convinced the Tsarina that Rasputin _was_ a holy man, and this brought them extremely close. It was told that the Tsarina had an affair with Rasputin, but there is not yet convincing proof.\n\n### Healing Powers\n\nIt was not until mid-1907 when the man presented his healing abilities. Alexis had fallen and suffered from an internal bleeding. Alexandra sent for Rasputin, and the next day Alexis was well. The Tsarina claimed that Rasputin had came in the night and prayed for the Tsarevich. Since then he was proclaimed as an incredible healer, and hundreds came to him for his powers. More importantly, Alexandra became convinced that Rasputin was a helper, messenger, and a savior sent by God.\n\nRasputin lived the following decade with what was known as a “double life.” He presented his best to the royal family, frequently conducting acts of curing. Many historians suspected that Rasputin utilized a powerful hypnosis, while others hypothesized that he had some special medicine. Perhaps it was just some psychological auto-suggestion. On the other hand, he had a messy, sexual life, often caught drunk with ladies heading back to his home. This indeed became a point of criticism of opposition. Leaflets filled St. Petersburg, and even though the Tsar did try once to banish him, Alexandra brought him back and Nicholas II never bothered to try again. Notably, [Pyotr-Stolypin](Pyotr-Stolypin) also tried, but Rasputin hurried back immediately hurried back after Stolypin was murdered.\n\n### War\n\nAfter the [War](Tsar-Nicholas-II]] left to the front commanding the [[Russian-Participation-In-World-War-One), Rasputin used his influence to control Russia.\n\nMany defeats in Germany in 1915 brought complaints towards the government. Suddenly, people noticed many officers and officials had German names. Rasputin was accused of working towards Russia’s defeat. As the Tsarina was from Hesse, the suspicion also flooded towards her.\n\nThis brought heavy criticism upon the royal family.\n\n### Bibliography\n\n- Hasic, Albinko. _5 Myths and Truths About Rasputin_. 29 December 2016. 01 11 2020. \u003chttps://time.com/4606775/5-myths-rasputin/\u003e.\n- Fuhrmann, Joseph T. _Rasputin: The Untold Story_.

To assess the significance of Sergei Witte, a comparison between him and one of his successors, [Stolypin](Pyotr-Stolypin), could be used. Stolypin took the place of Witte’s successor and continued on many policies of Witte. Points are separated into categories including economic, political, and social influences.\n\nFirstly, one of the biggest influences that Witte had on Russia was his push for industrialization. From 1890 to 1914, capital investment, the money used to buy technology and tools used in production, rose by more than 20%. As a result, coal production doubled, and other outputs also increased by great amounts. Since Russia did not previously own the high-skilled labour and technology required to achieve quick industrialization, he encouraged foreign skills to migrate into Russia. Foreign investments were also encouraged. He was also the first to stabilize the ruble to achieve these foreign trades. With experience as the Transport Minister, he also encouraged government stimulus in railway: the government bought large amounts of previously private-owned railways. In general, these reforms that he has brought upon Russia greatly improved its economy. In fact, after the war, Witte played a major role in restabilizing the economy from the revolution through negotiations with European banks, successfully acquiring loans that restored businesses. However, generally, the effect of these improvements is not as compelling: it had little effect on the lives of the peasants, perhaps even the workers. Little legislation was passed to protect their rights, as labour is always the biggest cost of production: it was against the interests of industries to do so. The peasants saw no big change before and after the 1905 revolution, nor under Witte. He was not interested in agriculture at all. In comparison, industries only accounted for 30% of the total Russian output, so the efficiencies of industrialization lacked potential for agriculture. Besides, Russia did not have the amount of capital and funds needed to achieve rapid growth in industry as Britain and the US had. The investments also backfired: many output produced in Russia were drained back to foreign investments, and Russian firms became crippled when the money did outflow. Russia became exploited by foreign investments. Some measures were used to protect local industries, for instance, the high tariffs, but it resulted in reduced standards of living, and costs of necessities rose.\n\nOn the other hand, as a successor to Witte, Stolypin did quite well in terms of agricultural improvements. He first continued industrialization as passed on from Witte, but most of his focus was on agriculture. He allowed peasants to buy and own land, gave subsidies, established banks, and a commission was set up to supervise and implement these changes. In return, the productivity in the agricultural sector grew by 14%, and 25% in Siberia. Economically, this brought benefits to more people when compared to Witte’s industrialization as the latter could not redistribute the gains made from the process. And, when including the fact that Russia was still an agricultural country at the time, these policies were the real game-changers. Despite the scale of changes brought to Russia by Witte, the policies of Stolypin, when given enough time, would have increased the general real income level and standards per capita.\n\nPolitically, the biggest changes that Witte brought took place during the 1905 revolution. He first negotiated the treaty with Japan, allowing the Tsar to withdraw the troops back to St. Petersburg. This was one of the key factors in stopping the revolution as the troops played an important role in confronting the Social Revolutionaries. He then persuaded the Tsar to publish the October Manifesto, which the Tsar heavily disliked, and allowed the Liberals to suspend their participation in the rebellion. This use of the disunity between the opposition groups further weakened the revolution, allowing the Tsarist regime to survive. As a side effect, the Duma was introduced in the Manifesto. This was the first instance of democracy happening in the autocracy, no matter whether if the Duma had any actual powers: it satisfied the middle classes. However, Witte resigned before the Duma was elected, and the first two Dumas were quickly dissolved by Stolypin, proving that it was just a puppet to entertain the people. Finally, to end the 1905 revolution, he used his power as the prime minister to suppress all social unrest close to the end of the revolution, whether it was soviet councils, mutinies, strikes, and uprisings. In summary, Witte was mainly important in the survival of the government during the 1905 revolution, but apart from 1905, his influence was minimal.\n\nIn contrast, Stolypin had a much bigger political influence. He was a conservative in terms of his opinions on the Tsarist regime, but he brought forth some rather aggressive policies when it comes to opposition. Despite that the October Manifesto stated that people had political rights, he still used the police and army to crush opposition. Fast trials were introduced, and people who opposed the Tsar were quickly sentenced to be hanged. Hence comes the nickname “Stolypin’s necktie.” Martial law was also fully utilized by Stolypin. He also controlled the Duma, making it more conservative, achieving a constitutional monarchy. The first two Duma’s failure resulted in a change in election weight of the different classes, achieving the conservative Duma as mentioned. The other statements in the October Manifesto were also defied by him: the loose censorship did not take place, and gatherings of opposition groups were either quickly dismissed or never dismissed. He also took a firm point when it comes to the royal family, specifically Rasputin. The effect of Rasputin on the reputation of the nobility was disliked by Stolypin. He managed to banish him from the capital, and then later went on a trip to Jerusalem, returning after the assassination of Stolypin. Stolypin’s importance can be seen from the multiple assassination attempts on him that Witte did not possess. He had too many policies, which resulted in more opposition. Hence, when it comes to politics, Witte had no big significance, especially when compared relatively with other political figures in the regime at the same time such as Stolypin.\n\nWitte’s industrialization brought up a group of middle classes: bankers, factory owners, professionals, etc. The class was new to Russian society, and it was a huge step forward in terms of capitalism. They were well educated, and had more radical demands in terms of politics and economy, later becoming the main pushing engine of the Liberals. However, his focus on industrialization resulted in a lack of attention on agriculture, and regular periods of famine stroked the country. The rapid rise of industries also resulted in bad conditions for the workers as the unemployment rate was large, and the cities were crowded. They had low pay due to the large working force, and there were nearly no non-pay benefits for them. As for the nobility, nothing barely changed. It is not wrong to say that Witte did not bring better living standards for the common citizens and lower classes: the middle classes were the biggest beneficiaries. However, he did not cause opposition and hatred towards the government: at least he was not a factor of it. Industrialization was still a key stage that every country has to go through to fully develop; he just brought it to Russia early.\n\nStolypin, however, brought great social unrest. He was seen as aggressive in character and policies, and people panicked upon his necktie that executed more than twenty-four hundred people. The lives of peasants improved: fewer taxes, surplus wealth. The peasant-owned farms slowly took place, but the transition took a long time: conservatives and landowners opposed the changes, and the effect did not reach its maximum potential before his assassination and WWI. Overpopulated regions were evacuated, and people were funded to journey into Siberia. The newly emerging class, the Kulaks, benefited the most, but the effect on other poorer peasants was minimal. Overall, he succeeded in creating progressive economic growth while not causing much opposition to the related policies. None of his successors tried to aim at increasing the lives of peasants until Khrushchev, but that is beyond the scope of the question.\n\nOverall, Sergei Witte is quite significant in his role in the industrialization of the Russian economy before 1914. He has brought forth many economically successful policies that pushed the process much faster than if he did not exist. Also, he played a key role in the survival of the Tsar in the 1905 Revolution. Stolypin and Witte were both influential, except that these influences were perhaps in different parts of the Russian society. Without Witte, the industrialization would possibly delay more than a decade or so. The Tsarist regime could also collapse during the 1905 revolution. That being said, Witte still lacked the ability to secure his own political position, otherwise his importance could have been even greater. Therefore, I believe that Sergei Witte was quite important in Russia’s history before 1914.\n",title:"Untitled Page"},"/Stalin-economic-policies":{content:"---\n---\n\n## Tags\n\n#history\n\n## Content\n\n### Industry\n\n#### Five Year Plans\n\nStalin had three five year plans before [World-War-Two](World-War-Two)\n\n### Agriculture\n\n- [USSR-collectivization](USSR-collectivization)\n",title:"Untitled Page"},"/Treaty-Of-Versailles":{content:'---\n---\n\n## Tags\n\n#history\n\n## Content\n\nTreaty between the Allies and Germany that ended [World War 1](202103141651-World-War-1).\n\n### Statements\n\n#### War Guilt Clause\n\nAlso known as **Article 231**, this places Germany to be blamed completely for the cause of the war.

We cannot live without help from others, and to do so, helping others. A simple proof will be to count the hours of each person being alone, and the hours of him/her communicating with other humans. Despite the attempts of becoming alone, I find myself in a desperate need of relationships. You see, people often has this falsified image that introverts tend to have a higher productivity than extroverts. I cannot deny this on the bases of statistics, but more often the relationships that a person possess may worth way more than himself working alone.\n\nYou can find anyone in the world with an average of nine people in between. This is what the statistic experts on the internet say. With that speaking, you can see every extra person you know as an extra weapon, an extra backup. Relationships are resources, ones that you can trade in for more relationships. You\'ll make yourself attractive by choosing attractive friends, or more effectively, knowing more people. "Walking out of your comfort zone" was never some "sharing is caring" preschool song. It is you guidelines to being more productive, having more people backing you up, and finding help when you need it. Social media and emails are your weapons.\n\nThat being said, you should never treat people like they are tools. Talk more, think more. Of course, don\'t just talk into the void thinking the more words the better.
